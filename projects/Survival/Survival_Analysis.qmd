Using Kaplan Meier curves and a Cox proportional hazard model, I analyzed the reliability of simulated turbo fan jet engines from data produced by Commercial Modular Aero-Propulsion System Simulation (C-MAPSS) developed by NASA. This paper and presentation was produced as part of the class STAT 453 "Survival Analysis" at Macalester College.
